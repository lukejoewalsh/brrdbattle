# about
The engineering course I was enrolled in at my high school allowed me to propose my own project for the end of my senior year. At the time I enjoyed designing and developing video games in my free time and wanted to incorporate that into my final project. To make it interesting I gave myself the constraint of developing a game that could be stored on a floppy disc I had recently received as a gift. Since floppy discs only have 1.44 MB this meant my game would have to take up less space than a typical photo shot on a smart phone.
